    [MADELINE left normal]
    Comf!

samah_gravityhelper_gravityhelpershowcase_dialog_intro=
    [MADELINE left sad]
    Urgh... where am I?

    [MADELINE left distracted]
    I vaguely remember something about chasing a bird...

    Welcome to GravityHelper!
    This is a showcase of some of the entities and features available in the mod.
    Feel free to open the map file to see how things are done.

    [MADELINE left sadder]
    Guess I'll see what's up ahead.

samah_gravityhelper_gravityhelpershowcase_dialog_notice=
    [MADELINE left determined]
    Hmm... what are those arrows?

    []
    Most entities and interactions in GravityHelper follow a common colour theme.
    {# 76CFFF}Blue{#} means normal gravity, {# F94A4A}red{#} means inverted gravity, and {# d678db}purple{#} means toggle.
    Arrows will generally point in the direction that {+MADELINE} will travel.

samah_gravityhelper_gravityhelpershowcase_dialog_field=
    Gravity fields will change {+MADELINE}'s gravity upon entry.
    They will also affect {+THEO} and jellies that are dropped or thrown.

samah_gravityhelper_gravityhelpershowcase_dialog_dreamblock=
    Gravity dream blocks will change {+MADELINE}'s gravity upon exit.

samah_gravityhelper_gravityhelpershowcase_dialog_what=
    [MADELINE left surprised]
    What just happened???

samah_gravityhelper_gravityhelpershowcase_dialog_booster=
    Gravity boosters will change {+MADELINE}'s gravity upon exit.
    They come in both {+AREA_4} and {+AREA_5} flavours.

samah_gravityhelper_gravityhelpershowcase_dialog_blood=
    [MADELINE left distracted upsidedown]
    The blood is rushing to my head.

samah_gravityhelper_gravityhelpershowcase_dialog_spring=
    Gravity springs will change {+MADELINE}'s gravity upon touch.
    They will also affect jellies or {+THEO}!

samah_gravityhelper_gravityhelpershowcase_dialog_badeline1=
    Gravity Badeline boosts will send you in the direction the arrow points.
    Each node can have a separate gravity setting.

    [MADELINE left together]
    Time for some fun!

    [BADELINE right yell]
    Leave me out of this!

samah_gravityhelper_gravityhelpershowcase_dialog_badeline2=
    [BADELINE angryAlt]
    That was awful.

samah_gravityhelper_gravityhelpershowcase_dialog_vvvvvv1=
    When VVVVVV mode is enabled, pressing jump while on the ground will flip {+MADELINE}'s gravity.{n}Dash and grab are disabled by default.

    [MADELINE left normal]
    Oh like that game?

    []
    No, not at all like that game. This is a different VVVVVV.

    [MADELINE left upset]
    Fine.

samah_gravityhelper_gravityhelpershowcase_dialog_vvvvvv2=
    Gravity lines will flip your gravity when you touch them. You can even have oblique lines!

    [MADELINE left distracted]
    This is sounding more and more like that game.

samah_gravityhelper_gravityhelpershowcase_dialog_vvvvvv3=
    [MADELINE left deadpan]
    Oh come on.

samah_gravityhelper_gravityhelpershowcase_dialog_vvvvvv4=
    [MADELINE left upset]
    Sellout.

samah_gravityhelper_gravityhelpershowcase_dialog_refill=
    Gravity refill crystals give you a "charge" of gravity toggle.  Dash to consume the charge and toggle gravity!
    Gravity bumpers will change your gravity upon touch.

samah_gravityhelper_gravityhelpershowcase_dialog_switch=
    [THEO right excited]
    Yo {# F94A4A}Strawberry{#}!

    [MADELINE left normal]
    Hey {+THEO}!
    What are you doing here?

    [THEO right wtf]
    Well I was just sitting here minding my own business...
    Y'know, {~}{# aaaaaa}"It's your boy {+THEO}{# aaaaaa} in this{n}weird cave, no big deal."{#}{/~}

    [THEO right thinking]
    {# ffff9b}\#upsidedown{#}

    [THEO right serious]
    I blacked out and woke up in this crystal.

    [MADELINE left normal]
    Any way I can help?

    [THEO right thinking]
    I'm not sure, but that heart looks enticing.

    [MADELINE left sad]
    But, I don't know how to reach it.

    [THEO right thinking]
    Hmmm... maybe I could help?

    []
    Gravity switches will change gravity when {+MADELINE} or a throwable object touches them.
    Try throwing {+THEO} onto the switch, but mind the spinners above you!

    [THEO right yolo]
